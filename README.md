# RainWizard

RainWizard is an ongoing rainfall prediction project currently under development by myself and a dedicated team. We are analyzing meteorological data from the past 8-10 years and experimenting with various regression models to identify the most effective approach for accurate predictions. Our goal is to develop a robust system that forecasts tomorrow's rainfall in millimeters and classifies the type of rainfall—whether no rain, moderate, or heavy—providing crucial insights for weather forecasting and planning.

## Project Goals

- **Accurate Rainfall Prediction**: Utilize historical meteorological data to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) for the next day.
- **Rainfall Classification**: Classify rainfall into categories: no rain, moderate rainfall, and heavy rainfall, to better understand weather patterns.
- **Model Experimentation**: Test and evaluate different regression models to determine the most accurate and reliable model for rainfall prediction.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering meteorological data from the past 8-10 years, including parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
2. **Data Analysis**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
3. **Model Development**: Developing and testing various regression models to predict rainfall and classify its type.
4. **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance based on accuracy, precision, and reliability to select the best model.

## Future Plans

- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning the selected models to improve prediction accuracy and classification reliability.
- **Integration with Weather Systems**: Collaborating with meteorological agencies to integrate the RainWizard model into their forecasting systems.
- **User Interface Development**: Building a user-friendly interface to make predictions accessible for various stakeholders, including meteorologists, farmers, and urban planners.
